---
- ❌ **No login or registration** - Authentication features are disabled
- ❌ **No cloud storage** - Data is NOT saved to Firebase database
- ❌ **No cloud sync** - Your data won't sync across devices
- ❌ **Sharing features disabled** - Cannot create public share links
- ✅ **All core features work** - Add books, track reading, organize library
- ✅ **Data saved locally** - Securely stored in your browser's localStorage
- ✅ **Works offline** - Fully functional without internet

#### 💡 Current Workflow:
1. Use the app normally - all features work!
2. **Export your library regularly** (Settings → Export) as backup
3. Keep export files safe
4. When authentication is fixed, you can import your data

#### ⚠️ Important Warnings:
- **Clearing browser data = losing your library!** Export regularly!
- **Data is device-specific** - Won't transfer to other devices
- **Use same browser** - Data doesn't transfer between browsers on same device

**Status**: We're actively working on fixing authentication. Expected in v1.2.0 update.

### Other Known Limitations

- ISBN scanner requires HTTPS (camera access restriction)
- Barcode scanning may not work on all devices or browsers
- Some ISBN lookups may fail due to external data source availability
- Large libraries (1000+ books) may experience slower load times
